# Cowrie

After writing a very simple shell (christened "shush") that can basically only
execute simple commands one at a time, I'm attempting to make something
more ambitious by using these university assignments as a guide for the
features I want to implement:

1. [CS 414 @ Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs414/2004su/homework/shell/shell.html)
2. [COMP 530 @ UNC](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~porter/courses/comp530/f23/lab1.html)

## Progress
- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [ ] Execute simple commands
- [ ] Handle input and output redirection
- [ ] Handle pipes
- [ ] Add scripting support
- [ ] Job control
- [ ] Managing environment variables
- [ ] Maintain command history
